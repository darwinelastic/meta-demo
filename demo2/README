Apache 2.0 Module Developer Tutorials

	A barebones module that does nothing except
	write a silly message to stderr (meaning
	error_log) when a GET request is processed.
						
	The reason this module is so trivial is
	because most of the tutorial focusses on
	the build environment and the logistics of
	compiling a kernel and getting it loaded
	into Apache.
